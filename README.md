# Cicero

Cicero is a sysex librarian with knowledge about the device it communicates with. The main goal for this project is to make it easy to organize patches. 

I started this project when I bought a TC Electronics Nova System guitar effect pedal, so this is the first device type that will get support. I will not actively work for adding *all* devices, only devices I have. Anyone is though free to create support for their favorite devices.
